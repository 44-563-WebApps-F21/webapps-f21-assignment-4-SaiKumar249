    <p class="FIRST-SOLDIER">FIRST SOLDIER <p class="stage-directions">[_throws dice_]</p>

        <p class="speech">Sixes again! good Pietro.</p>
     
     <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">I’ faith, lieutenant, I will play with thee no more.  I will lose
        everything.</p>
     
        <h6 class="THIRD-SOLDIER">THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
       <p class="speech"> Except thy wits; thou art safe there!</p>
     
         <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
         <p class="speech">Ay, ay, he cannot take them from me.</p>
     
        <h6 class="THIRD-SOLDIER">THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">No; for thou hast no wits to give him.</p>
     
        <h6 class="THE-SOLDIER">THE SOLDIERS <p class="stage-directions">[_loudly_]</p></h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Ha! ha! ha!</p>
     
        <h6 class="FIRST-SOLDIER">FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Silence!  You will wake the prisoner; he is asleep.</p>
     
        <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">What matter?  He will get sleep enough when he is buried.  I warrant
        he’d be glad if we could wake him when he’s in the grave.</p>
     
        <h6 class="THIRD-SOLDIER">THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Nay! for when he wakes there it will be judgment day.</p>
     
        <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Ay, and he has done a grievous thing; for, look you, to murder one of
        us who are but flesh and blood is a sin, and to kill a Duke goes being
        near against the law.</p>
     
        <h6 class="FIRST-SOLDIER">FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Well, well, he was a wicked Duke.</p>
     
        <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">And so he should not have touched him; if one meddles with wicked
        people, one is like to be tainted with their wickedness.</p>
     
        <h6 class="THIRD-SOLDIER">THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Ay, that is true.  How old is the prisoner?</p>
     
        <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Old enough to do wrong, and not old enough to be wise.</p>
     
        <h6 class="FIRST-OLDIER">FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Why, then, he might be any age.</p>
     
        <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">They say the Duchess wanted to pardon him.</p>
     
        <h6 class="FIRST-SOLDIER">FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Is that so?</p>
     
        <h6 class="SECOND-SOLDIER">SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p class="speech">Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not.</p>
