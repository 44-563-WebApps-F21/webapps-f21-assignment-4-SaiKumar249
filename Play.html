    <p>FIRST SOLDIER [_throws dice_]

        Sixes again! good Pietro.
     
     <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>I’ faith, lieutenant, I will play with thee no more.  I will lose
        everything.</p>
     
        <h6>THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
       <p> Except thy wits; thou art safe there!</p>
     
         <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
         <p>Ay, ay, he cannot take them from me.</p>
     
        <h6>THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>No; for thou hast no wits to give him.</p>
     
        <h6>THE SOLDIERS [_loudly_]</h6>
     
        <p>Ha! ha! ha!</p>
     
        <h6>FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Silence!  You will wake the prisoner; he is asleep.</p>
     
        <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>What matter?  He will get sleep enough when he is buried.  I warrant
        he’d be glad if we could wake him when he’s in the grave.</p>
     
        <h6>THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Nay! for when he wakes there it will be judgment day.</p>
     
        <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Ay, and he has done a grievous thing; for, look you, to murder one of
        us who are but flesh and blood is a sin, and to kill a Duke goes being
        near against the law.</p>
     
        <h6>FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Well, well, he was a wicked Duke.</p>
     
        <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>And so he should not have touched him; if one meddles with wicked
        people, one is like to be tainted with their wickedness.</p>
     
        <h6>THIRD SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Ay, that is true.  How old is the prisoner?</p>
     
        <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Old enough to do wrong, and not old enough to be wise.</p>
     
        <h6>FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Why, then, he might be any age.</p>
     
        <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>They say the Duchess wanted to pardon him.</p>
     
        <h6>FIRST SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Is that so?</p>
     
        <h6>SECOND SOLDIER</h6>
     
        <p>Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not.</p>
