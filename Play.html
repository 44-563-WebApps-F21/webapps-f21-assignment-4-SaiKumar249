    <h3>Act V : _The Dungeon_</h3>
    <p>FIRST SOLDIER [_throws dice_]

        Sixes again! good Pietro.
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        I’ faith, lieutenant, I will play with thee no more.  I will lose
        everything.
     
     THIRD SOLDIER
     
        Except thy wits; thou art safe there!
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        Ay, ay, he cannot take them from me.
     
     THIRD SOLDIER
     
        No; for thou hast no wits to give him.
     
     THE SOLDIERS [_loudly_]
     
        Ha! ha! ha!
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        Silence!  You will wake the prisoner; he is asleep.
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        What matter?  He will get sleep enough when he is buried.  I warrant
        he’d be glad if we could wake him when he’s in the grave.
     
     THIRD SOLDIER
     
        Nay! for when he wakes there it will be judgment day.
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        Ay, and he has done a grievous thing; for, look you, to murder one of
        us who are but flesh and blood is a sin, and to kill a Duke goes being
        near against the law.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        Well, well, he was a wicked Duke.
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        And so he should not have touched him; if one meddles with wicked
        people, one is like to be tainted with their wickedness.
     
     THIRD SOLDIER
     
        Ay, that is true.  How old is the prisoner?
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        Old enough to do wrong, and not old enough to be wise.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        Why, then, he might be any age.
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        They say the Duchess wanted to pardon him.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        Is that so?
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        Ay, and did much entreat the Lord Justice, but he would not.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        I had thought, Pietro, that the Duchess was omnipotent.
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        True, she is well-favoured; I know none so comely.
     
     THE SOLDIERS
     
        Ha! ha! ha!
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        I meant I had thought our Duchess could do anything.
     
     SECOND SOLDIER
     
        Nay, for he is now given over to the Justices, and they will see that
        justice be done; they and stout Hugh the headsman; but when his head
        is off, why then the Duchess can pardon him if she likes; there is no
        law against that.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        I do not think that stout Hugh, as you call him, will do the business
        for him after all.  This Guido is of gentle birth, and so by the law
        can drink poison first, if it so be his pleasure.
     
     THIRD SOLDIER
     
        And if he does not drink it?
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        Why, then, they will kill him.
     
                                                [_Knocking comes at the door_.]
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        See who that is.
     
             [_Third Soldier goes over and looks through the wicket_.]
     
     THIRD SOLDIER
     
        It is a woman, sir.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        Is she pretty?
     
     THIRD SOLDIER
     
        I can’t tell.  She is masked, lieutenant.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        It is only very ugly or very beautiful women who ever hide their
        faces.  Let her in.
     
          [_Soldier opens the door_, _and the_ DUCHESS _masked and cloaked
                                     enters_.]
     
     DUCHESS [_to Third Soldier_]
     
        Are you the officer on guard?
     
     FIRST SOLDIER [_coming forward_]
     
        I am, madam.
     
     DUCHESS
     
        I must see the prisoner alone.
     
     FIRST SOLDIER
     
        I am afraid that is impossible.  [_The_ DUCHESS _hands him a ring_,
        _he looks at and returns it to her with a bow and makes a sign to the
        Soldiers_.]  Stand without there.
     
                                                       [_Exeunt the Soldiers_.]
     
     DUCHESS
     
        Officer, your men are somewhat rough.
